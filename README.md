# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection-using-Machine-Learning
- We have implemented a machine learning model using python, pandas, and scikit-learn to check the transaction database 
  and train the model to be able to classify new transactions as fraudulent or not.
- As we are dealing with a binary problem, we will use the logistic regression to check if the transactions can be labeled as is fraud or not fraud.
- For that Logistic Regression will be used.
